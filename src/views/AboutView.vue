    <p class="text-lg my-4">
      We are a group of concerned community members who think that no one should have to be cold in
      our society. We believe that shelter is a basic human right and that there is more than enough
      for everyone. Until the structural issues that cause homelessness are addressed, we will
      continue to provide resources to those in need.
