    The Heater Bloc is a community initiative to provide heaters to those in need. The heaters are
    designed to be safe and easy to use. We don't want anyone to be cold and feel like matters need
    to be taken into our own hands.

      This mission is accomplished by building copper coil alcohol heaters. These heaters are safe
      to use and put themselves out when knocked over. They allow for a safe and easy way to provide
      heat to those in need. Using a copper coil and alcohol, the heaters allow cheap fuel sources
      to be used to provide heat. The heaters can be built by anyone with the right materials. The
      coil is placed in a container and alcohol is poured into the container. The coil is then lit
      on fire and the alcohol burns inside the coil. The coil heats up and provides heat to the
      surrounding area. The heaters are safe to use and put themselves out when knocked over.
